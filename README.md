# Basic_Actor_Critic_Model
Tensorflow implementation of basic actor_critic algorithm.  
The Actor_Critic algorithm is the combination of Policy_Gradient and DQN.  
The gradient of actor_critic algorithm is as follows:

If you do not know Policy_Gradient or DQN,I suggest you go to see my project about both first.    
I train the model to play CartPole-v0.   
You can Change code to play other OpenAi Gym games.    
You can also Optimize this algorithm.
